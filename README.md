Usage
-----

On first startup the app prompts you for a name for your KINOS or KISTO device and the IP address. Your KINO/KISTO needs to be connected to your network, and a fixed IP address must be configured for it.
You can add additional devices in the application menu.

Once you added a device you can select it from the device list in the main screen.

If your device is switched on an reachable via network the device control screen allows you to switch the device on and off, change the volume, mute it, select the input profile, and select the surround mode. Also, the current setting for operation state, volume, input profile, and surround mode is displayed.

Opening the app menu from the device control screen allows you to edit the device settings, delete the device, and display the device information (including software version and total operation time).
